# EasyR1: An Efficient, Scalable, Multi-Modality RL Training Framework

This project is a clean fork of the original [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl) project to support vision language models, we thank all the authors for providing such a high-performance RL training framework.

EasyR1 is efficient and scalable due to the design of **[HybirdEngine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19256)** and the latest release of **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)**'s SPMD mode.

## Features

- Supported models
  - Qwen2/Qwen2.5 language models
  - Qwen2/Qwen2.5-VL vision language models
  - DeepSeek-R1 distill models

- Supported algorithms
  - GRPO
  - others RL algorithms (comming soon)

- Supported datasets
  - Any text, vision-text dataset in a [specific format](#custom-dataset).

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- transformers>=4.49.0
- flash-attn>=2.4.3
- vllm>=0.7.3

We provide a [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to easily build environments.

### Hardware Requirements

\* *estimated*

| Method                   | Bits |  1.5B  |   3B   |   7B   |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| GRPO Full Fine-Tuning    |  AMP | 2*24GB | 2*40GB | 4*40GB |

> [!NOTE]
> We are working hard to reduce the VRAM in RL training, LoRA support will be integrated in next updates.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiyouga/EasyR1.git
cd EasyR1
pip install -e .
pip install git+https://github.com/hiyouga/MathRuler.git
```

### GRPO Training

```bash
bash examples/run_qwen2_5_vl_7b_geo.sh
```

### Merge Checkpoint in Hugging Face Format

```bash
python3 scripts/model_merger.py --local_dir path_to_your_last_actor_checkpoint
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you encounter issues with connecting to Hugging Face, consider using `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`.
>
> If you want to use SwanLab logger, consider using `bash examples/run_qwen2_5_vl_7b_geo_swanlab.sh`.

## Custom Dataset

The dataset should strictly follow the example data format.

- Text dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hiyouga/math12k
    - Required columns: problem, answer

- Vision-text dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/hiyouga/geometry3k
    - Required columns: images, problem, answer

## TODO

- Support PPO, Remax, Reinforce++ and RLOO for VLMs.
- Support padding-free training for VLMs.
- Support ulysses parallelism for VLMs.
- Support more VLM architectures.

### Known bugs

These features are temporarily disabled for now, we plan to fix them one-by-one in the future updates.

- Vision language models are not compatible with padding-free training and ulysses parallelism yet.
- Vision language models are not compatible with `enable_chunked_prefill` unless [vLLM v1](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/01/27/v1-alpha-release.html) is supported.
